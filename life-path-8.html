          <p>In Numerology, People with the Life Path Number 8 are usually associated with being natural and prolific leaders. They have excellent management skills and are always up to achieving something great, especially when involved in financial or business matters. There is clarity in their understanding of the physical and the material world which makes them at the top of their game. They tend to know what may or may not work through their intuitions. They are here to serve a greater vision and a higher purpose to attain something which is enormous in its magnitude.</p>
          <p>If your Life Path Number is 8, then as per life path numerology, there is a spark in you which not many people recognize. Even when you do try to share your goals with a specific understanding that people may not be able to reciprocate, you push them to come out of their comfort zones to put more efforts to reach that goal, which is a significant trait found in a leader. You are an action-oriented person, and that is why people seek power, courage and some motivation from you, to keep on giving their best as you are the one who inspires them the most. They want you to provide them with a little push so that they can work hard and prove themselves to be passionate as well. Furthermore, you may turn out to be the most successful monetarily compared to any other Life Path Number, but no matter what, sincere efforts may be required to achieve the same.</p>
          <h4>Life Path Number 8 Characteristics: Positives & Negatives</h4>
          <p>As we have already discussed that you hold great power and potential to become a leader, especially in financial matters, you also have to realize that with great power comes great responsibility and that you have to focus on how such power can come of use to humanity as a whole. It is essential to realize this because if you do not, then there is a possibility that you may become very gluttonous and materialistic by nature, which may not be a good sign.</p>
          <p>If your Life Path is 8, It may deprive you of understanding the true meaning of having a lot of wealth and power and using it in a useful manner. There is also a possibility of losing everything just because of the amount of greed you may hold where you may risk it all to get some more. So, it may be vital for you to inculcate the tendency to come back from significant failures like a lion and opt for the righteous path instead of giving in to greed, wealth and power. There is also a possibility that you may come across significant failures in life, but it may not be as hard for you to come back strong like a warrior and mend things. Therefore, it is crucial to realize these things before it is too late as you hold the pessimistic idea towards being humane and progressive in your essence. There is also a possibility that you may experience a collapse in your married life which may turn out to be expensive and exorbitant for you. So, be careful!

          <h4>Life Path Number 8: Career & Business</h4>

All the financial areas of life like Business, Real Estate, Law, Science and managing large and reputed institutes can be something to look forward to. You will also be lured towards positions which can be very influential and can hold great power. There are a lot of other options like a reputed Government job, social work, Politics, etc where you can try your hands on as they all come with a handsome amount of money and power as well. Also, in all these cases you will get an opportunity to be persuasive, inspiring and a noteworthy influence on others.</p>
          <h4>Life Path Number 8: Love Life</h4>
          <p>Being a hardworking and an intellectual soul, you are very good at reading people. It helps you reach out to the right kind of people who can be on the same page with you. You give a lot of importance to power and money, and you tend to thrive on it, but you will have to make sure that you do not overdo it. Because there is a thin line between being confident and over-confident. Another essential feature in people with 8 as their life path numerology number is that they are not very expressive of their love, affection for others. For more details, know about your numerology love reading. You may find it difficult to express your feelings to others apart from spending a lot of money on them which should be avoided.</p>
          <p>However, In Numerology Life Path Number 8 comes with some danger as well which people should be ready for. You can build a powerful ground on which you can connect with more people who can support you at the time of need. However, it is more important to see that you do not use your wealth and power for a wrong cause or your profit. There are chances that you may become unrighteous in your direction and amoral in your ways with so much control over your power and wealth. It is not that difficult to become a bit arrogant, overconfident or authoritative with this much capability. Therefore, keeping a check and becoming conscious of what you do is the only solution through which you may not misuse the power you have.</p>
          <p>All this may eventually make you lonely, disrespected and less loved which is not something that you may want. You may end up hurting the ones closest to you. Thus, being responsible, sensible and aware of your actions is the foremost thing that you should consider instead of just focusing on your wealth and image. Do not become dominating, dishonest or too self-centered as there are chances of you becoming a little impatient, uncompromising and conceited if you are not aware enough to recognize this. Otherwise, you are someone we need in this world for the betterment of the human civilization. You might like to read about Numerology Number 8</p>
