          <h2>The Pythagorean Theorem means what?</h2>
          <p>
            When you live in this life, it's not always the case that you know
            exactly what you're doing, what career to choose, how to live your
            life, or what your personality is like. Sometimes, you may find
            yourself fascinated by someone and want to understand them better,
            or you might want to learn about your colleagues at work and the
            environment around you. By doing so, you can comprehend why people
            behave the way they do, identify their strengths, and then adapt
            your approach to interact with and handle each person accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like you, if you understand the unique influence of your birth
            date and how it shapes your life, you can make adjustments and live
            a better and more beautiful life. This understanding can lead to
            improved relationships with those around you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Numerology can be described as a study of self-discovery and
            exploring the presence or absence of numbers in one's birth date and
            name, as well as the relationships between those numbers.

            <h2>Your life's direction</h2>
            <p>If you are unsure about what you should do in life or where to go, or if you are feeling unhappy and unfulfilled, numerology can be a potential solution. Numerology can be likened to a GPS map for your life. Just as you need Google Maps to navigate from one province to another, numerology can help you understand how your life is designed. It can guide you on a direct path towards your goals, and success may come to you more easily because you are moving in the right direction and saving time.</p>

        <h2>Why did we create this website?</h2>
        <p>Numerology is not astrology! It is a scientific discipline because scientists following the Pythagorean school of thought have stated: "Each number is a vibration corresponding to a number of cycles per second." Thus, each number has its own unique vibration, in which a tree, a blade of grass, a human body, an emotion, a thought, etc., all have specific corresponding vibrational frequencies to certain numbers.</p>
        <p>Numology.com asserts with great confidence that our lives are intricately connected to numbers. We have created a calculation tool to assist you in understanding and mastering the numbers in your life!</p>

            <h2>Who is Pythagorean (Py-ta-go)?</h2>
            <p>I remember! When we were still in secondary school, we learned about Pythagorean's important mathematical formulas, for example, the formulas to calculate angles and the relationships between angles in a right triangle. However, not everyone might know that Pythagoras was also a philosopher and a mathematician. He had significant influences on other philosophers and mathematicians like Aristotle, Plato...</p>
