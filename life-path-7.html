You may become gloom-ridden and a bit selfish by nature as well which will create a lot of distance between you and other people and hamper your relationships. Keeping away from people will have a pessimistic influence on you, but it may also deprive you of the love, affection. You must remember that you’re not the center of the universe. The world does not revolve around you. Therefore, interaction with people will give you a reality check.
